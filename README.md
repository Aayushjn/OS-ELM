# OS-ELM

In this repository, we provide a Numpy implementation of Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) introduced by Liang et al. in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4012031/).

### Dependencies
We tested the code by using the following libraries:
  * Python==3.6.6
  * numpy==1.15.3
  * pandas==0.23.4
  * scikit-learn==0.20.0
  * tqdm==4.28.1
  * matplotlib==3.0.1
  
The libraries can be downloaded using the following commands:
  * `pip install -U numpy scikit-learn pandas`
  * `conda install numpy scikit-learn pandas`


### Usage
To run the code simply execute the following command:
`python <file_name>.py`
